""" The module governing tables and objects that represent what are known as
    Services (defined below) in Aquilon.

    Many important tables and concepts are tied together in this module,
    which makes it a bit larger than most. Additionally there are many layers
    at work for things, especially for Host, Service Instance, and Map. The
    reason for this is that breaking each component down into seperate tables
    yields higher numbers of tables, but with FAR less nullable columns, which
    simultaneously increases the density of information per row (and speedy
    table scans where they're required) but increases the 'thruthiness'[1] of
    every row. (Daqscott 4/13/08)
