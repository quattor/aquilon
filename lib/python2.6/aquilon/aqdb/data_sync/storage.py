    Scan a storeng-style data file, checking each line as we go

    Storeng-style data files are blocks of data. Each block starts
    with a comment describing the fields for all subsequent lines. A
    block can start at any time. Fields are separated by '|'.
    This function will invoke the function after parsing every data
    line. The function will be called with a dict of the fields. If the
    function returns True, then we stop scanning the file, else we continue
    on until there is nothing left to parse.
