"""The main class here is ResponsePage, which contains all the methods
for implementing the various aq commands.

To implement a command, define a transport for it in input.xml and
then add a command_<name>[_trigger] method to the ResponsePage class.
Any variables in the URL itself will be available as
request.args["varname"][0] where "varname" is the name of the
option.  (Any normal query/post variables will also be in this dict.)

The pages are built up at server start time based on the definitions in
the server's input.xml.  The RestServer class (which itself inherits
from ResponsePage for serving requests) contains this magic.  This
class builds out all the ResponsePage children as part of its __init__.

For any given ResponsePage, all methods (including all the command_
methods) are available, but only the expected methods for that relative
URL will be assigned to render_GET, render_POST, etc.  The rest will be
dormant.

As the request comes in (and passes through the various
getChildWithDefault() calls) it will be checked for extensions that
match the available format functions.  A request for location.html,
for example, will retrieve 'location' and format it with format_html().

ToDo:
    - Possibly massage the incoming data - simplify lists back to
        single variables, handle put content, etc.
    - Add some sort of interface that can be implemented for
        objects to give hints on how they should be rendered.
    - Add other output formats (csv, xml, etc.).
