"""Initialize each broker command and make it easy to load by installing
   an instance of the command as broker_command in the module.

   This ends up importing everything... any script in this directory
   will end up being triggered any time any module in this directory is
   loaded - side effects and all.

   Once loaded, this iterates through each module, finds the subclass of
   BrokerCommand and installs it as broker_command.  The module name is
   then added to __all__.
