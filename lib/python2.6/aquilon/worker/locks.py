# The concept of a "compile" lock somewhat oversimplifies.
# Broadly speaking there are four phases:
# 1 - Read plenary templates and profile templates for comparison.
# 2 - Write changed plenary templates and profile templates.
# 3 - Read relevant plenary, profile, cached profile, and domain
#     templates for compile.
# 4 - Copy (write) compiled profiles and cache profile templates.
#
# If in phase one it is determined that a template will not be
# changed and a certain lock is not needed, then that template
# must not be rewritten in phase two.
#
# The compile lock is described in terms of output profiles,
# which really only matter in phase four.  This seems like a
# relatively sane approach as generally the profile is the thing
# we actually care about being in a good state.
