    """Store status information for each incoming request.

    Each request will get one of these objects to write status
    information into.  Other commands (currently only show_request)
    can attach StatusSubscriber instances that will be called whenever
    new status info is available.  The info is stored as LogRecord
    objects from the python logging module.

    The initial implementation of this class used Condition objects to
    send notifications about available messages.  This caused two
    problems.  First and most important, deadlocks.  This code needs
    to work from threads that are themselves using lock mechanisms.
    Second, speed.  Anything beyond the simple Lock mechanism is
    implemented in python (that is, not natively).  Performance is
    horrible.

    The current implementation uses callbacks to reduce the number
    of threads touching this object.  Since there could be multiple
    threads we still need to lock operations that change internal
    state.  The lock in use is the primitive Lock provided by python.
    It is the only lock construct implemented natively in cPython
    (as of 2.5) - the rest are built on top of it.
