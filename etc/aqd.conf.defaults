# Generally, the server will point at /etc/aqd.conf (see
# etc/aqd.conf.example for an example of a prod config file) or a
# developer will use etc/aqd.conf.dev or a copy.  This file is always
# read first when determining configuration, and supplies all defaults.
# This behavior has been hard-coded into the config.py methods.
#
# If a value is missing from here *and* not supplied later, the broker
# might fail.  The purpose of this file is to make sure that all values
# that might be read have some valid default.
#
# A value should *not* be removed from this file without confirming
# that the source code does not reference it.
#
# Best practice is to only override as necessary.
